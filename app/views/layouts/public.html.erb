    <meta name="description" content="Moran Hook Architecture is a practice of classically trained architects and designers based in New York. As architects, we find great pleasure in formulating intelligent, creative, and enduring design solutions that meet our clientsâ€™ individual needs. We feel that a project's utility, beauty, and integrity are realized through intimately understanding its site and landscape, discerning the project's appropriate character, and artfully integrating all of its details to bring a sense of ease and timelessness.  We strive to continue the traditions of architecture in today's world by rooting our work in the knowledge of the past while designing places that speak to the tastes and lifestyles of modern living.">
